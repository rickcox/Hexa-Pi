# Hexa-Pi
A Case for the Hexa-Pi board.

![Better Picture TBD](Hxsa-Pi_Case/CadPic.pdf)

This is a fairly simple case for the Hexa-Pi board.
It consists of 4 parts:
- A bottom
- A top - with the PCB connector ends fully exposed
- A Front Panel - this has cutouts for the 6 external connectors
  It is recommended to make this out of semitransparent material so the
  LEDS are readily visible
- A Back Panel - This has cutouts for the power, ethernet, USB and HDMI connectors.
  It is recommended to make this out of semi-transparent material so the
  LEDS are readily visible

In addition, there is a standOff. 4 of these can be used for stacking 

For good airflow, a 120MM fan is inset on the top.  
This makes the case larger, but provides good airflow without alot of sound,
and allows stacking of Hexa-Pi's.

Additional hardware needed to assemble 1 board and case:
- 6 M3 heatset fittings. these are heat-set into the bottom - 2 near the center to
  hold the PCB from flexing, and 4 on the corners to secure the top.
- 6 10MM M3 bolts - 2 to hold the PCB, and 4 to secure the case top to the PCB and bottom
  Hex head rather than Phillips head is preferred.
  The 4 corners are difficult to access due to being deeply inset - SORRY!
- 6 4MM M3 bolts or tapered screws to hold the front and back panels on
- A 120MM X25MM fan with a 4 pin PWM connector
  A fan which includes a finger guard/screen is recommended for safety
  If the fan has a long lead, either wrap it around the fan side or zip-tie to the case.
- M5 bolts are usually provided with fans to hold the fan in place.
  Insert from inside the case and thread into the fan housing

I dislike the way the long, deeply inset corner screws work. 
They are difficult, and time consuming to assemble and dis-assemble.
Also the attachment of the front and back panels could be improved.
**I would love some sort of snap on case, but my mechanical CAD skills don't go there yet!**
