Things-To-Do if another version (1.2?):

  - change 5ohm to 470ohm on NeoPixel Data - R75

  - Improve esd protection of emc2301 fan controller.
    Try esd diodes and series resistors?

  - Move j1-j6 0.3mm closer to top board edge
    0.2mm cu to board edge since this is routed, not v-scored
    0.1mm more - reduce size of MP pad

  - Move uSD,J19,J21 closer to bot board edge
    0.2mm CU to board edge since this edge is routed, not v-scored

  - Move M.2 connr and holes x-=0.5 to improve holddown screw clearance

  - Enlarge pads on usbc Connector - Avoid full soldermask on Top
    Use footprint Molex_xxxxxx_MOD - has small (>0) soldermask on front.

  - M.2 Connector - reduce size of thermal gaps - difficult to hand solder!
    Width to 0.13mm, Length to 0.4mm

  - DNP on I2C pullups - R98, R105. There are already pullups on the CM4.
    add a DNP pullup on TACH2 signal - near TACH1 pu?

  - Tighten up spacing on switch straps - ~1.0mm to mid, ~0.5mm right.

  - usb and enet switch - adjust thermal vias to minimize solder wicking

  - Consider switching usb switch USB2524 for SL2.1A
    Simpler, cheaper, bigger!

  - Try to avoid having to use layer In2 for SD_CMD from uSD.

  - Label +12 and GND near 12V fan connectors

  - Eliminate R115 - SD_DET is unused on uSD

  - Update footprint on NeoPixel - silkscreen only to show orientation better
  
  - Place (47uF) 0805 Caps near top power exit point for 5V to stop sags.

  - Include at least 1 USB3 port from Pi5CM - bottom smt connr?

  - flip pins on J18 iand label - keep power/gnd square/round consistent.

  - Move USB-C connector away from board edge by 1 mm.

  - Move power jack closer to board edge. (0.20 mm ?)

  - A few miscellaneous track/routing cleanups
