The PCB is meant to be mounted with the top and bottom edges exposed, since therre are used connectors and LEDS there.
Along the top edge are the 6 Activity LEDS, and 6 external connectors for each Module.
Along the bottom - left to right are:
- Power in - nominally 12V. Thsi viltae is used directly for the fan, so a 12V fan is required.
  If the fan is not considered, the on board power regulators should work with from 8V to 15V.
- Red Power on LED.  12V ison the board
